# Busy - keep computer awake


### What is it?
A small and primitive utility for preventing computer from going to sleep.

### Why?
When computers are idle they become sleepy: first they dim 
the screen, then turn it off and finally go to sleep. This utility checks 
if computer is idle and sents some harmless keyboard and mouse input.

### Code features
* Single C file
* Needs only basic stuff to build: free Community VisualStudio will do

### Functionality
* Configurable frequency of sending user input
* Option to start the program when the user logs in

### Usage
1. Place EXE wherever you like
2. Start the program
3. Find program icon in tray, double-click to activate (red icon) 
   or deactivate (grey icon)
4. Alternatively right-click on the tray icon for some basic "Settings..."

### Building
Run build.bat from the Visual Studio prompt.
